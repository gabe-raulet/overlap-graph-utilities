Will use a collection of modules to handle this problem.

Module:
    Take a fasta file with species info included in each read's header as
    input, output paf alignments.

Module:
    Take paf file and edge filter parameters as inputs and output paf file with
    edges filtered.

Module:
    Take paf file as input and produce gml graph file.

Module:
    Take fasta file and read.vs.species map to produce fasta file with species
    info included in header.
